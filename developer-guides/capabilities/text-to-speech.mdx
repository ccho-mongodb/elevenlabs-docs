## Overview

The ElevenLabs Text to Speech API turns text into lifelike speech using our advanced [models](/developer-guides/models). It can be used to:

- Create immersive audiobooks in 32 languages
- Generate natural-sounding voice-overs
- Deliver real-time conversational AI responses

Here is an example of the `Nicole` voice (`piTKgcLEGmPE4e6mEKli`):

## Quickstart

The `text-to-speech` endpoint takes in three key inputs: the [model](/api-reference/text-to-speech), the [text](/api-reference/text-to-speech) that should be turned into audio, and the [voice](/api-reference/text-to-speech) to be used for the audio generation. A simple request would look like the following:

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
    from elevenlabs import play

    client = ElevenLabs()

    audio = client.text_to_speech.convert(
        text="The first move is what sets everything in motion.",
        voice_id="JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb",
        model_id="eleven_multilingual_v2",
        output_format="mp3_44100_128",
    )

    play(audio)
    ```

    ```javascript Javascript
    import { ElevenLabsClient, play } from "elevenlabs";

    const client = new ElevenLabsClient();
    const audio = await client.textToSpeech.convert("JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb", {
        text: "The first move is what sets everything in motion.",
        model_id: "eleven_multilingual_v2",
        output_format: "mp3_44100_128",
    });

    await play(audio);
    ```
