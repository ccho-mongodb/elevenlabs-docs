## Publishing new versions

When using the web dashboard to configure an assistant, you're working on a dedicated draft version that's not accessible through any of the external channels, including:
- Custom integration with your app
- Embedded widget on your website
- Shareable link

Publishing creates a snapshot of your assistant's current state, and makes it accessible through the channels you've configured.
You can publish your assistant from the **Publish** tab in the agent configuration.

<Frame>
  !["Publish" tab in the agent configuration](/conversational-ai/images/publishing-first-time.webp)
</Frame>

Afterward, you can continue to modify and test the draft version without affecting the live assistant.
Once you're satisfied with the changes, you can publish the updated version to make it available to your users.

## Reverting to a previous version

At any time you can roll back to a previous version of your assistant.
This can be useful if you've made changes that didn't work as expected.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the rollback dialog">
    Click on the three-dot menu in the top right corner and select **Rollback version**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Roll back to a previous version">
    In the dropdown, select the version you want to revert to and click **Rollback**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Unpublishing an assistant

After you've published an assistant, you can unpublish it to make it inaccessible to users.
To do so, click on the three-dot menu in the top right corner and select **Unpublish**.

## Disabled publishing

Older assistants created before the introduction of publishing need to opt in to the new system.
To enable publishing in a legacy assistant, navigate to the "Publish" tab and click **Enable publishing**.
